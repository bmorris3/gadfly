Getting started
===============

gadfly provides custom Gaussian process kernels
that are useful for approximating solar and stellar irradiance
power spectra and their time series. The kernels are
constructed with ``celerite2``. See the
`celerite2 docs <https://celerite2.readthedocs.io/>`_ for
links to background on GPs, and an introduction to simple
harmonic oscillator kernels.

Solar power spectrum
--------------------

Observations of the total solar irradiance (TSI) power spectrum
are the basis of our understanding of helio- and asteroseismology.
``gadfly``'s kernels and their hyperparameters are built on fits
to the `SOHO VIRGO/PMO6 <https://www.pmodwrc.ch/en/research-development/solar-physics/virgo-data-products-archived_webpage/>`_
TSI observations spanning 1996-2016. They were taken at
one-minute cadence and are available online [1]_.

Below we download the SOHO VIRGO observations over one year (6 MB),
compute and bin the solar power spectrum, construct a kernel that
approximates the solar power spectrum, and plot both the modeled and
observed power spectra.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    from gadfly import SolarOscillatorKernel, PowerSpectrum
    from gadfly.sun import download_soho_virgo_time_series
    import astropy.units as u

    # Download a year of the total solar irradiance observations
    # from SOHO VIRGO PMO6:
    light_curve = download_soho_virgo_time_series(
        full_time_series=False
    )

    # Compute the power spectrum from the SOHO time series
    ps = PowerSpectrum.from_light_curve(light_curve)

    # Generate a celerite2 kernel that approximates the solar
    # power spectrum with one-minute cadence
    kernel = SolarOscillatorKernel(
        # set the observing cadence:
        texp=1 * u.min,
        # set the observing bandpass
        bandpass='SOHO VIRGO'
    )

    # Plot the kernel's PSD, and the observed (binned) solar PSD:
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 3.5))

    # Plot one PSD with coarse binning:
    kernel.plot(
        ax=ax[0],
        # plot the observed power spectrum
        obs=ps.bin(bins=50)
    )

    # Plot another PSD with finer binning and p-modes:
    kernel.plot(
        ax=ax[1],
        p_mode_inset=True,
        # also plot the observed power spectrum
        obs=ps.bin(bins=1_500),
        obs_kwargs=dict(marker='.', mfc='C1', ms=1)
    )

The high power at low frequencies corresponds to super-granulation, and
the several plateaus in power at mid-range frequencies correspond to
meso-granulation, g-modes, and granulation [2]_. The series of
peaks near a few thousand microhertz are the p-mode oscillations.

The blue model in the plot above is the power spectrum of the
:py:class:`~gadfly.SolarOscillatorKernel`, which returns a
kernel object that can be used to compute GPs with ``celerite2`` [3]_.
The kernel hyperparameters that define the shape of the blue model kernel
are derived from a fit to the solar PSD observations from SOHO VIRGO [4]_.
Under the hood, the :py:class:`~gadfly.SolarOscillatorKernel` is a sum of
many simple harmonic oscillator kernels.

.. [3] The kernels provided by ``gadfly`` are subclasses of the
   :py:class:`~celerite2.terms.TermConvolution` object in ``celerite2``.
.. [4] We did not need to explicitly supply the :py:class:`~gadfly.Hyperparameters` for the
   solar example because the :py:class:`~gadfly.SolarOscillatorKernel` class assumes the
   solar hyperparameters. This assumption is relaxed in the next subsection.

Stellar power spectra
---------------------

Astronomers have carefully calibrated *asteroseismic scaling relations*, which
define transformations to the amplitudes, frequencies, and spectral-widths
of solar oscillations as functions of fundamental stellar properties like mass,
radius, temperature, and luminosity. For ``gadfly``, we've curated a set of those
transformations in :py:mod:`~gadfly.scale`. The literature sources for these
scaling relations are spread across several papers cited throughout the docstrings.

``gadfly`` provides a lightweight framework for manipulating the solar kernel
hyperparameters, stored in a :py:class:`~gadfly.Hyperparameters` object, to
produce sets of hyperparameters that describe stars other than the Sun.
We apply scaling relations to each of the solar hyperparameters to
estimate/predict kernels for different star in the
:py:class:`~gadfly.Hyperparameters` class method
:py:meth:`~gadfly.Hyperparameters.for_star`.

Let's say we have a set of five stars with high-quality spectroscopic stellar
parameters, as well as years of archival *Kepler* photometry [5]_. Let's write
out their key properties:

.. code-block:: python

    import astropy.units as u

    # Some (randomly chosen) real stars from Huber et al. (2011)
    kics = [9333184, 8624155, 3120486]
    masses = [0.9, 1.8, 1.9] * u.M_sun
    radii = [10.0, 8.8, 6.7] * u.R_sun
    temperatures = [4919, 4944, 4929] * u.K
    luminosities = [52.3, 41.2, 23.9] * u.L_sun

    stellar_props = [
        kics, masses, radii, temperatures, luminosities
    ]

Now we have all we need to tell ``gadfly`` how to make a custom kernel
for each star. We can create a :py:class:`~gadfly.Hyperparameters`
instance with the spectroscopic parameters, and then build a
``celerite2``-compatible :py:class:`~gadfly.StellarOscillatorKernel`
for each star. :py:class:`~gadfly.StellarOscillatorKernel` is just a
generalization of the :py:class:`~gadfly.SolarOscillatorKernel`.

.. code-block:: python

    from gadfly import StellarOscillatorKernel, Hyperparameters

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))

    plot_frequencies = np.geomspace(0.1, 300, 25_000) * u.uHz

    # iterate over each star:
    for i, (kic, mass, rad, temp, lum) in enumerate(zip(*stellar_props)):
        # scale the set of solar hyperparameters for each
        # Kepler star, given their (spectroscopic) stellar parameters
        hp = Hyperparameters.for_star(
            mass, rad, temp, lum,
            name=f'KIC {kic}', quiet=True
        )

        # Assemble a celerite2-compatible kernel for the star,
        # observed in the Kepler bandpass at 1 min cadence:
        kernel = StellarOscillatorKernel(
            hp, texp=1 * u.min,
            bandbass='Kepler/Kepler.K'
        )

        # Plot the kernel's PSD:
        kernel.plot(
            ax=ax,
            freq=plot_frequencies
        )

    # Label the legend, set the power range in plot:
    legend = ax.legend(title='Simulated kernels')
    ax.set_ylim(1, 1e6)

.. plot::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import astropy.units as u
    from gadfly import StellarOscillatorKernel, Hyperparameters

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))

    # Some (randomly chosen) real stars from Huber et al. (2011)
    # https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...743..143H/abstract
    kics = [9333184, 8624155, 3120486]
    masses = [0.9, 1.8, 1.9] * u.M_sun
    radii = [10.0, 8.8, 6.7] * u.R_sun
    temperatures = [4919, 4944, 4929] * u.K
    luminosities = [52.3, 41.2, 23.9] * u.L_sun

    stellar_props = [kics, masses, radii, temperatures, luminosities]

    plot_frequencies = np.geomspace(0.1, 300, 25_000) * u.uHz

    # iterate over each star:
    for i, (kic, mass, radius, temperature, luminosity) in enumerate(zip(*stellar_props)):
        # scale the set of solar hyperparameters for each
        # Kepler star, given their (spectroscopic) stellar parameters
        hp = Hyperparameters.for_star(
            mass, radius, temperature, luminosity,
            name=f'KIC {kic}', quiet=True
        )

        # Assemble a celerite2-compatible kernel for the star:
        kernel = StellarOscillatorKernel(hp, texp=1 * u.min)

        # Plot the kernel's PSD:
        kernel.plot(
            ax=ax,
            freq=plot_frequencies
        )

    # Label the legend, set the power range in plot:
    legend = ax.legend(title='Simulated kernels')
    ax.set_ylim(1, 1e6)

The resulting plot has "simulated" power spectra for the five stars, built by
scaling the observed solar oscillations and granulation, which were parameterized by
the :py:class:`~gadfly.SolarOscillatorKernel`. Note how the amplitudes,
characteristic frequencies, and mode FWHM's vary with stellar properties. Cool!

To compare these predicted kernel PSDs to real Kepler photometry of these stars,
continue to :doc:`validation`.
